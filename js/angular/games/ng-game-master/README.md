This talk was delivered at ng-europe, October 23, 2014 by Ari Lerner ([ng-newsletter.com](http://ng-newsletter.com) | [fullstack.io](http://fullstack.io))

Although the game itself is relatively complete (game over states not quite implemented fully, chat, etc. incomplete), this repository is intended on demonstrating how to build complex, multiplayer games with Angular and Phaser.

Technologies used:

* [Phaser](http://phaser.io)
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)
* [socket.io](http://socket.io)
* [node](http://nodejs.org)
* [express](http://nodejs.org)

```bash
$ node index.js

That's it! Then head to your browser to: `http://localhost:8000` and see the wonder
